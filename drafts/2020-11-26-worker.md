```javascript
const { Worker, isMainThread, parentPort } = require("worker_threads");
if (isMainThread) {
  // This code is executed in the main thread and not in the worker.

  // Create the worker.
  const worker = new Worker(__filename);
  // Listen for messages from the worker and print them.
  worker.on("message", (msg) => {
    console.log(msg);
  });
} else {
  // This code is executed in the worker and not in the main thread.

  // Send a message to the main thread.
  parentPort.postMessage("Hello world!");
}
