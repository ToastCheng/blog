GC:
- tracking memory allocations in heap memory
- releasing allocations that are no longer needed
- keeping allocations that are still in-use

Collection phase
- mark setup - STW
- marking - Concurrent
- mark termination - STW

### 1. mark setip
- turn on Write Barrier (check if concurrent is safe)
- stop goroutine

goroutine stop them self (function call, tight loop might delay STW)

### 2. Marking
- inspect the stacks to find root pointers to the heap.
- traverse the heap graph from those root pointers
- mark values on the heap that are still in-use

do that in a reason amount of time
and spend little resource

-  collector takes 25% of available CPU

### Mark Assist
The mark assist time of a goroutine ‚àù the allocation it makes

- Slow down allocations , in turn speed up collection.
- Goal of the collector is to eliminate  
### 3. Mark Termination
- Turn the Write Barrier off.
- Various clean up tasks are performed.
- Next collection goal is calculated.

 
### Pacing algorithm
- determine when a collection is to start.
- Feedback loop to gather information about the running application and stress.
- Stress that determines the pace at which the collector needs to run.
