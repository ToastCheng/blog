SRID or Coordinate Reference System Identifier 

MySQL databased comes with more than 5000 of such coordinate systems which you can check using below query
```
SELECT `srs_name`, `srs_id`
FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.ST_SPATIAL_REFERENCE_SYSTEMS
```

WKT for a point is 2D cartesian coordinates is as simple as string “POINT(X, Y)” where X and Y are axial distances from the origin. While in spherical coordinate system X and Y of POINT(X, Y) is latitude and longitude value respectively. 

```
SET @p1 := POINT(0,0);
SET @p2 := POINT(3,4);
SELECT ST_Distance(@p1, @p2);
```
(default SRID = 0, means 2D)
ST_ => spatial type

`ST_GeomFromText(geom_wkt, [srid], [options])`

```
SET @p1 := ST_GeomFromText('POINT(0 0)');
SET @p2 := ST_GeomFromText('POINT(3 4)');
SELECT ST_Distance(@p1, @p2);
```


As we know, MySQL stores a geometry data type in BLOB format

Convert to different form:
```
SELECT
ST_AxText(@p1) AS 'wkt_value',
ST_AxBinary(@p1) AS 'wkb_value',
ST_AxGeoJson(@p1) AS 'geo_json_value';
```

get x, y:
```
SELECT
ST_X(@p1) AS 'p1_x',
ST_Y(@p1) AS 'p1_y';

CREATE TABLE location (
  `position` POINT NOT NULL SRID 0,
  ...
)

```
SET @user_location = ST_GeomFromText( 'POINT(0 0)' );
SELECT 
    *,
    ST_AsText(`position`) AS `pos_wkt`,
    ST_Distance(`position`, @user_location) AS `distance`
FROM
    `locations_flat`
WHERE ST_Distance(`position`, @user_location) <= 100;
```

or user `ST_Buffer` and `ST_Within`:
ST_Buffer(位置, 距離)
```
SET @user_location = ST_GeomFromText( 'POINT(0 0)' );
SET @area_to_search = ST_Buffer( @user_location, 100 );
SELECT 
    *,
    ST_AsText(`position`) AS `pos_wkt`,
    ST_Distance(`position`, @user_location) AS `distance`
FROM
    `locations_flat`
WHERE ST_Within( `position`, @area_to_search );
```

MySQL use R-Tree to store SPATIAL INDEX.
It is good at multi-dimensional data

Also, SRID for the geographic coordinate system is 4326

```
CREATE TABLE location (
  `position` POINT NOT NULL SRID 4326,
  ...
)
```
POINT(lat, long)
lat: 0-90
long: 0-180

ST_Distance_Sphere(g1, g2, [, radius(m)])

SET @lotus_temple := ST_GeomFromText( 'POINT(28.553298 77.259221)', 4326, 'axis-order=lat-long' );
SET @india_gate := ST_GeomFromText( 'POINT(28.612849 77.229883)', 4326 );
SELECT
    ST_Latitude( @lotus_temple ) AS `lat_lotus_temple`,
    ST_Longitude( @lotus_temple ) AS `long_lotus_temple`,
    ST_Latitude( @india_gate ) AS `lat_india_gate`,
    ST_Longitude( @india_gate ) AS `long_india_gate`,
    ST_Distance_Sphere( @lotus_temple, @india_gate ) AS `distance`;
