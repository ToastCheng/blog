### Weave Scope

Keep track of TCP connections between containers
use `kprobes` to track `connect`, `accept`, `close`

### Linux networking

tc (traffic control)/ qdisc ( queueing discipline)

eth0 --> qdisc --> internet
every network interface can be attached to a qdisc
qdisc will schedule the package to emit when it is allowed

install all the qdisc

## cilium

- network security L7
- fine grained routing
- load balancing, kubernetes service

k8s still map to iptable

```
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp \
-s 15.15.15.3 \
--dport 80 \
-m conntrack \
--ctstate NEW \
-j ACCEPT
```

most of the clous native infra, the communication between containers is over port 80

as you open port 80, you open a door invite every traffic in.

bpf inject bytecode to your kernel at runtime.
bytecode goto verification by kernel to make sure nothing will break
21:56 we find a bug, modify, redeploy it, not a single connection is lost
atomically replace the bpf

L3 policy

- Labels based
- Classless inter-domain routing (CIDR)

L4 policy

29:27
L7 policy

23:49
iptable rules, every package pass through
O(n)

cilium hashtable
O(1), no matter how many rules

30:17
sidecar proxy
service mesh
L7 load balancer

```
[ server -> proxy ] [ proxy -> server ]
              └─────────┘
```

31:44
from service to service you go from TCP for 6 times.
3x socket memory requirement
3x TCP/IP traversal
3x context switch

32:42
kernel proxy

kTLS kernel TLS

36:05
Socket redirect
