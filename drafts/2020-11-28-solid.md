SOLID
aiming to 
- make the codebase more maintainable
- make the codebase more extendable
- make the codebase easy to read

### 1. Single Responsibility Principle
- A class should have one and only one reason to change
- Precise names for many small classes > generic names for large classes

### 2. Open Closed Principle
- A class should be open for extension but closed for modification
- Adding new code instead of changing existing code

Factory pattern

### 3. Liskov Substitution Principle
- derived class should be able to substitute its parent class without the consumer knowing it

Database engine 
Duck typing
break interface into pieces 
Duck -> Flyable, Quackable 

### 4. Interface Segregation Principle
- No client should be forced to depend on methods it does not use
- 


don't pass the concrete class, pass the interface you really need
```go
type B struct {}

func (b B) b1() {

}

func (b B) b2() {

}

func a(b B) {
    return b.b1()
}
```

```go
type interfaceForA interface {
    b1()
}

func a(b interfaceForA) {
    return b.b1()
}
```


### 5. Dependency Inversion Principle
Never depend on anything concrete, only depend on abstractions
