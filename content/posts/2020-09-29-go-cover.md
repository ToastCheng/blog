When writing software for production, inevitably you will have to write 
some unit test to ensure the functionalities are working just fine in certain scenario.

Though it is hard to test every potential cases in practice, there are some practical measures you can rely on to inspect what percentage your code is tested, the coverage.

## Built-in coverage tool

Usually you will use `go test .` to run test files, and in addition, `go test . -v` to inspect some log if necessary.

If you want to know the coverage of the test, you can run:
```shell
➜  go test . -cover
ok      some_pkg      0.466s  coverage: 91.6% of statements
```

Here you can see that there are 91.6% of code tested.

Note that even 100% does not guarantee all the scenario has been tested, just means that the code has been tested in limited ways.

## Visualize

But how do I know which line of code has not been tested?
We can definitely do better. By `-coverprofile`:
```shell
➜  go test . -coverprofile cover.out
ok      some_pkg      0.466s  coverage: 91.6% of statements
```
The `-coverprofile` tells go test to generate a profile of coverage.
You will find out it is hard to read. That's because it should be read by:

```shell
➜  go tool cover -html=cover.out 
```

It will open a browser and display the profile with a basic UI.

But it contains meaningful information! You can inspect that the line painted in red is actually some code that has not been tested, figure a way to test it :)
